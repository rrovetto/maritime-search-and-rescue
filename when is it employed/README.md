# When is maritime SAR employed?

Maritime search and rescue is employed at all times it is needed. Distress at sea can occur at any moment, which calls for emergency response at any momeent. 
The ideal temporal extent of maritime SAR is therefore constant, continguous, and perpetual. This, of course, depends on the available resources.
