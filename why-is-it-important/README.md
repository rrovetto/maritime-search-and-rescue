# Why is it important? / Why should I care?
Maritime SAR is important because it is an essential service, namely life-saving at sea.

It's **tradition** arguably spans the history of maritime operations: mariners helping others in distress at sea. Philosophically, the sea presents a common challenge, enemy, or problem to all persons. It thereby calls for all persons to help one another when in need.

**Legally**, good samaratins and vessels of opportunity, are called upon to assist other maritime vessels or persons in distress. 

**Economically**, the ocean is a medium to carry essential goods and services to all nations. The safeguarding of the vessels (and crew) transporting those goods/services is (or should be) therefore a priority.

**Ethically**, the inherent and assumed value of all human life demands for its safeguarding and rescue, whether at sea or otherwise.
